*Baggage - The total number of passenger complaints for theft of baggage contents, or for lost, damaged, or misrouted luggage for the airline that month

*Scheduled - The total number of flights scheduled by that airline that month

*Cancelled - The total number of flights cancelled by that airline that month

*Enplaned - The total number of passengers who boarded a plane with the airline that month

moving averages

```{r}
# Calculate moving averages
bag.ts.trailing <- rollmean(bag.ts, k = 12, align = "right")
bag.ts.ma.centered <- rollmean(bag.ts, k = 12, fill = NA)  # Using rollmean for centered moving average

# Plotting
plot(bag.ts, ylim = c(1000, 35000), ylab = "Baggage", xlab = "Time", bty = "n", xaxt = "n",
     xlim = c(2004, 2010), main = "")
axis(1, at = seq(2004, 2010, 1), labels = seq(2004, 2010, 1))
lines(bag.ts.ma.centered, lwd = 2, col = "blue")  
lines(bag.ts.trailing, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = "red") 

# Adding legend
legend("topright", legend = c("Baggage Complaint", "Centered Moving Average", "Trailing Moving Average"),
       lty = c(1, 1, 2), lwd = c(1, 2, 2), col = c("black", "blue", "red"))

```

moving average does not work well with the data that have trend or seasonality. The  moving average does not capture the seasonality in the data. Seasons with high baggage complaints are under-forecasted, and seasons with low baggage complaints are over-forecasted.

simple exponential smoothing model

test.ts <- window(bag.ts, start = c(2010, 07), end = c(2010, 12))

ses <- ets(training.ts, model = "ANN", alpha = 0.2)
ses.pred <- forecast(ses, h = 6, level = 0)
ses.pred

plot(ses.pred, ylim = c(1000, 35000),  ylab = "Baggage Complaints (Twice-Differenced)", xlab = "Time",
    bty = "l", xaxt = "n", xlim = c(2004, 2011), main = "", flty = 2)
axis(1, at = seq(2004, 2011, 1), labels = format(seq(2004, 2011, 1)))
